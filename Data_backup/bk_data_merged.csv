As she and Peeta travel throughout the districts, Katniss senses a rebellion is stirring. However, President Snow (Donald Sutherland) proves that he is still very much in control when word comes of a cruel change in the rules for the upcoming 75th Hunger Games.","Smart, smoothly directed, and enriched with a deeper exploration of the franchise's thought-provoking themes, Catching Fire proves a thoroughly compelling second installment in the Hunger Games series.","['Catching Fire delivers on the grim, roiling promises of the original.', ""Director Francis Lawrence's film runs nearly two-and-a-half hours but it concludes so abruptly and tantalizingly, it leaves you wanting more."", 'Far from being a mere holding pattern, Catching Fire feels like an advance and an improvement. Let the games continue.', 'Gary Ross did the hype justice by kicking off the series with a highly effective adaptation and now Francis Lawrence builds upon that success by taking the budget boost and funneling it into top talent, stunning visuals and an all-consuming experience.', 'Given the strength of this installment, I\'d say the box-office odds continue to be, in that Hunger Games catchphrase, ""ever in its favor.""', 'It is heartening to find a teen-oriented movie franchise as gritty as The Hunger Games. Even so, Catching Fire remains contradictory, caught in some nether world between nightmarish political allegory and adolescent escapism.', ""It's mainstream entertainment, but it succeeds at being riveting and deeply unsettling mainstream entertainment that casts a critical light on our current systems."", 'Like Katniss, Lawrence has become bigger than the Games themselves, something that makes her very powerful, very dangerous and rather inspirational.', 'None of it would work -- not the action, the adventure, the political subtext or the humor -- without the strength and beauty that Ms. Lawrence brings to the central role.', 'Now the violence is not merely physical, but existential. Far from having won her freedom as promised, Katniss is now imprisoned in a false public narrative-supporter of the Capitol, lover of Peeta-from which she may never escape.', 'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire takes the narrative and thematic liberties traditionally granted the middle chapter in a trilogy and drives the stakes up sharply.', 'The budget is nearly twice the original, and it shows. Great work from the A-list cast, amazing set designs and costumes.', ""The grand climax, whose elements include a long piece of wire, a lightning bolt, and an electronic force field, is an incoherent, rapid blur that will send the audience scurrying back to the book to find out what's supposed to be going on."", 'The movies (gratefully) violently counteract any attempt we might make to see them as fun escapism.', 'The one truly fresh invention-and the one that matters most-is Katniss herself. With each on-screen chapter, the poor girl from District 12 continues to fulfill her destiny as an inspiration and a rebel fighter.', ""This follow-up to the 2012 hit based on Suzanne Collins' novel, represents commendable storytelling that ought to please the book's many fans"", ""This is Empire Strikes Back stuff. It has that second Star Wars movie's kick of confidence."", 'This second in the Hunger Games trilogy, directed by Francis Lawrence, has many of the virtues and somewhat fewer defects as its predecessor.', 'Though some of the chases and escapes are thrillingly filmed, this last section of the film feels indistinguishable from plenty of other video-game-style avoid-the-obstacle action climaxes.', 'Vivid, visceral filmmaking, twisty and entertaining, with startlingly good turns by Jennifer Lawrence and Philip Seymour Hoffman.']"

At the same time, Katniss also learns about a secret rebellion spreading throughout all of Panem -- a rebellion that will place her at the center of a plot to turn the tables on Snow.","The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 sets up the franchise finale with a penultimate chapter loaded with solid performances and smart political subtext, though it comes up short on the action front.","['""Mockingjay - Part 1,"" however well done, can\'t compete with the first two films, although it sets up what should be its stunning ending well enough.', 'A solid lead-up to the finale.', 'A spiky media satire about the making and marketing of a revolution that most definitely will be televised.', 'As an actress, Lawrence has grown beyond this sort of thing, and the entire enterprise, directed by Francis Lawrence, feels like a massive placeholder for the grand finale.', ""If Mockingjay - Part 1 is quieter and less flashy than its predecessors, that doesn't make it less satisfying."", 'In the excitable world of dystopian fantasy, the series remains the best of the bunch.', ""It may be the franchise's third movie, but it plays like its 'Empire Strikes Back.'"", ""It's an elaborate game of hurry-up-and-wait.

Probably. Nonetheless, Mockingjay Part 1 is a fine entertainment, shot through with moments of surprising emotional impact."", ""Mockingjay has more exposition than a TED Talk, more rubble than a decade of The Flintstones, and absolutely no nonmonetary reason to be Part 1 of anything. It isn't storytelling. It's a filibuster."", ""Mockingjay, Part 1 might be the least of the films so far, but in dissecting the typical blockbuster film, it's staying true to that spirit."", 'Once you accept that the splitting of Mockingjay is a business decision, not a dramatic imperative, Part 1 comes off as a curiously satisfying nonaction movie.', ""The converted will be satisfied, or at least show up to the theater in obeisant force. Money will be made and anticipation stoked for next year's blowout finale. It's a circle-vicious to some, a religion to others-with no end in sight."", 'The effect of so many Oscar-calibre actors speaking the generic dialogue is like watching pro ballplayers play T-ball.', 'The meat of this franchise seems more in line with Edward Bernays than any fantasy or sci-fi author. This latest edition takes public relations to its bloodiest extreme.', 'The penultimate episode in the franchise feels like the mighty inhale that precedes a noisy, explosive sneeze. We must wait another year for release.', 'This is certainly a film adults can get into. The explosions, propaganda techniques, and unrest are a reminder of a history not entirely out of reach; a world and society all too realistic. for many living today.', ""To say Lawrence is a terrific actress wouldn't even scratch the surface, as she deserves high praise for somehow making an uninteresting Part 1 watchable.""]"

But one person Forrest cares about most may be the most difficult to save -- his childhood love, the sweet but troubled Jenny (Robin Wright).","Forrest Gump may be an overly sentimental film with a somewhat problematic message, but its sweetness and charm are usually enough to approximate true depth and grace.","['A dark and driven work, haunted by violence, cruelty and a sense of the tragically absurd.', 'A weirder, darker, and better movie than its reputation suggests.', 'All this might have seemed like pressing optimism a bit without the bland but still potent presence of Tom Hanks at its centre, clearly on his way to another Oscar nomination.', ""Contrasting Forrest's unassuming innocence with the upheavals and rancor of the times, the film is a wisely goofy commentary on the stupidity of smartness."", 'Credit for the success of the film has to start with director Robert Zemeckis, who has taken his Back to the Future and Who Framed Roger Rabbit success and parlayed it into a more mature, yet equally entertaining, film.', 'For all its ambition, the movie ends up using great historical events in the service of a dubious sentimentality.', 'Forrest Gump is a schmaltz-Zelig, a Being There engineered from the genetic material of a Hallmark card.', 'Forrest Gump, the new Tom Hanks movie directed by Robert Zemeckis, is a one-of-a-kind treat.', ""Good as Wright and Sinise are in their roles as Forrest's near-suicidal soulmates, the movie always comes back to Hanks, and director Robert Zemeckis helps him to achieve some of his finest emotional moments."", ""I can't see how people with low I.Q.s or those who love them are in any way comforted by all this hogwash. I can easily see how such people might be offended by its smug unreality."", ""It might hit you right in the feels, even as your eyes are rolling. To quote one of Forrest's truest pieces of wisdom: Maybe both is happening at the same time."", 'It remains a bad movie that gets worse with age.', ""It's most successful when it is being off-center, a state of grace it doesn't quite have the nerve to maintain."", ""It's too specific to be a proper allegory, and too vague to provide a satisfactorily millennial perspective on the last 50 years. Neither is it caustic enough to make one cry, nor soppy enough to make one laugh."", 'Self-ingratiatingly, and for this viewer maddeningly, it blends the comic with the Christly, the satirical with the sentimental, the free-thinking with the fuddy-duddy.', ""So afraid to dredge up debate that when Forrest is handed a mic at an antiwar rally, someone unplugs the speakers so we can't hear him - fitting for a movie with nothing to say."", ""The movie's technical tricks are great fun, as is its musical soundtrack, which captures the essences of the eras it traverses. But when you come right down to it, it's the oddly magnetic personality of Forrest himself that is the biggest draw."", ""This isn't the meaningful movie it pretends to be. But as a goofy entertainment that speeds through the latter half of the 20th century, stopping here and there to snap a photo or two, Forrest Gump does just fine."", 'This tall tale may reach monumental proportions, but Forrest Gump always keeps its magical airiness and grace.', 'Warm, wise, and wearisome as hell.']"

What lies ahead are mortal traps, dangerous enemies and moral choices that will ultimately determine the future of millions.","With the unflinchingly grim Mockingjay Part 2, The Hunger Games comes to an exciting, poignant, and overall satisfying conclusion.","['A movie that is too silly to be so somber, and too somber to be much fun.', ""After the forced histrionics of Part 1, it's nice to see star Jennifer Lawrence being allowed to quiet down and act again. But the story still feels stretched, a countdown that slows as it approaches zero hour."", 'All hail to the humongous Hunger Games franchise.', ""As wobbly as Mockingjay - Part 2 is, it's powerful because its characters and conflicts have become so familiar in the culture, and because it completes a long and painful journey."", ""Despite exhilarating special effects and action sequences, Katniss meets her waterloo in 'Mockingjay' Part 2"", 'Director Francis Lawrence (no relation to Jennifer) has steered this big, unwieldy ship of a story safely into harbor.', 'Director Francis Lawrence stages the action sequences... with a modicum of flair, and Julianne Moore as rebel leader Coin gives off some sparks, but for the most part there is nothing divertingly new or different about this franchise fade-out.', 'Explosive, mostly true to the text, complex and chock full of action, ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2"" should more than satisfy the franchise\'s many fans.', ""For the past three falls, a new 'Hunger Games' movie has come around to remind us that so many of its elements - blockbuster franchise, YA novel adaptation, multiple films from one book - aren't inherently evil."", 'If Mockingjay - Part 1 was walkier and talkier than its forerunners, Part 2 is pretty much all action - and lesser for it.', ""So much better than last year's plodding, aimless Part 1."", ""Still a strong effort, and I respect the heck out of the filmmakers' collective efforts to maintain thematic fidelity to the overarching ideas Collins' novels deftly end up exploring."", ""The Hunger Games movies began with much promise but after the pinnacle of Catching Fire, it has been a slog to the finish line. We're finally there and I feel more exhausted than fulfilled."", ""The Hunger Games, which kicked off in a blaze of guts 'n' glory in 2012, ends now with a sad whimper, along with a lot of big bangs signifying nothing."", 'The best thing about The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 is how unconcerned it is with what we expect in terms of closure of a happy ending.', 'The final installment of the ""Hunger Games"" franchise manages to give us everything we\'ve been waiting for and still underwhelm.', ""There are frequent close-ups that showcase Jennifer Lawrence's extraordinary expressiveness; like Katniss for the rebels, Lawrence is the film's figurehead, not only its protagonist but also bearing the entire burden of representing its narrative."", ""There are some complex ideas about power and corruption at play, and it's good to see this final instalment refusing to sell out either its role model heroine or its darkly dystopian sociopolitical themes."", 'This Hunger Game is one too many, a 2010-era cash grab in its purest form, more akin to a stern-faced curtain call than a fleshed-out story with a beginning, middle, and end.', 'This revenge plot animates Mockingjay Part 2 with a satisfying rage.']"
