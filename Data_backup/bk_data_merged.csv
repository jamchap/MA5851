As she and Peeta travel throughout the districts, Katniss senses a rebellion is stirring. However, President Snow (Donald Sutherland) proves that he is still very much in control when word comes of a cruel change in the rules for the upcoming 75th Hunger Games.","Smart, smoothly directed, and enriched with a deeper exploration of the franchise's thought-provoking themes, Catching Fire proves a thoroughly compelling second installment in the Hunger Games series.","['Catching Fire delivers on the grim, roiling promises of the original.', ""Director Francis Lawrence's film runs nearly two-and-a-half hours but it concludes so abruptly and tantalizingly, it leaves you wanting more."", 'Far from being a mere holding pattern, Catching Fire feels like an advance and an improvement. Let the games continue.', 'Gary Ross did the hype justice by kicking off the series with a highly effective adaptation and now Francis Lawrence builds upon that success by taking the budget boost and funneling it into top talent, stunning visuals and an all-consuming experience.', 'Given the strength of this installment, I\'d say the box-office odds continue to be, in that Hunger Games catchphrase, ""ever in its favor.""', 'It is heartening to find a teen-oriented movie franchise as gritty as The Hunger Games. Even so, Catching Fire remains contradictory, caught in some nether world between nightmarish political allegory and adolescent escapism.', ""It's mainstream entertainment, but it succeeds at being riveting and deeply unsettling mainstream entertainment that casts a critical light on our current systems."", 'Like Katniss, Lawrence has become bigger than the Games themselves, something that makes her very powerful, very dangerous and rather inspirational.', 'None of it would work -- not the action, the adventure, the political subtext or the humor -- without the strength and beauty that Ms. Lawrence brings to the central role.', 'Now the violence is not merely physical, but existential. Far from having won her freedom as promised, Katniss is now imprisoned in a false public narrative-supporter of the Capitol, lover of Peeta-from which she may never escape.', 'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire takes the narrative and thematic liberties traditionally granted the middle chapter in a trilogy and drives the stakes up sharply.', 'The budget is nearly twice the original, and it shows. Great work from the A-list cast, amazing set designs and costumes.', ""The grand climax, whose elements include a long piece of wire, a lightning bolt, and an electronic force field, is an incoherent, rapid blur that will send the audience scurrying back to the book to find out what's supposed to be going on."", 'The movies (gratefully) violently counteract any attempt we might make to see them as fun escapism.', 'The one truly fresh invention-and the one that matters most-is Katniss herself. With each on-screen chapter, the poor girl from District 12 continues to fulfill her destiny as an inspiration and a rebel fighter.', ""This follow-up to the 2012 hit based on Suzanne Collins' novel, represents commendable storytelling that ought to please the book's many fans"", ""This is Empire Strikes Back stuff. It has that second Star Wars movie's kick of confidence."", 'This second in the Hunger Games trilogy, directed by Francis Lawrence, has many of the virtues and somewhat fewer defects as its predecessor.', 'Though some of the chases and escapes are thrillingly filmed, this last section of the film feels indistinguishable from plenty of other video-game-style avoid-the-obstacle action climaxes.', 'Vivid, visceral filmmaking, twisty and entertaining, with startlingly good turns by Jennifer Lawrence and Philip Seymour Hoffman.']"

Probably. Nonetheless, Mockingjay Part 1 is a fine entertainment, shot through with moments of surprising emotional impact."", ""Mockingjay has more exposition than a TED Talk, more rubble than a decade of The Flintstones, and absolutely no nonmonetary reason to be Part 1 of anything. It isn't storytelling. It's a filibuster."", ""Mockingjay, Part 1 might be the least of the films so far, but in dissecting the typical blockbuster film, it's staying true to that spirit."", 'Once you accept that the splitting of Mockingjay is a business decision, not a dramatic imperative, Part 1 comes off as a curiously satisfying nonaction movie.', ""The converted will be satisfied, or at least show up to the theater in obeisant force. Money will be made and anticipation stoked for next year's blowout finale. It's a circle-vicious to some, a religion to others-with no end in sight."", 'The effect of so many Oscar-calibre actors speaking the generic dialogue is like watching pro ballplayers play T-ball.', 'The meat of this franchise seems more in line with Edward Bernays than any fantasy or sci-fi author. This latest edition takes public relations to its bloodiest extreme.', 'The penultimate episode in the franchise feels like the mighty inhale that precedes a noisy, explosive sneeze. We must wait another year for release.', 'This is certainly a film adults can get into. The explosions, propaganda techniques, and unrest are a reminder of a history not entirely out of reach; a world and society all too realistic. for many living today.', ""To say Lawrence is a terrific actress wouldn't even scratch the surface, as she deserves high praise for somehow making an uninteresting Part 1 watchable.""]"

I can easily see how such people might be offended by its smug unreality."", ""It might hit you right in the feels, even as your eyes are rolling. To quote one of Forrest's truest pieces of wisdom: Maybe both is happening at the same time."", 'It remains a bad movie that gets worse with age.', ""It's most successful when it is being off-center, a state of grace it doesn't quite have the nerve to maintain."", ""It's too specific to be a proper allegory, and too vague to provide a satisfactorily millennial perspective on the last 50 years. Neither is it caustic enough to make one cry, nor soppy enough to make one laugh."", 'Self-ingratiatingly, and for this viewer maddeningly, it blends the comic with the Christly, the satirical with the sentimental, the free-thinking with the fuddy-duddy.', ""So afraid to dredge up debate that when Forrest is handed a mic at an antiwar rally, someone unplugs the speakers so we can't hear him - fitting for a movie with nothing to say."", ""The movie's technical tricks are great fun, as is its musical soundtrack, which captures the essences of the eras it traverses. But when you come right down to it, it's the oddly magnetic personality of Forrest himself that is the biggest draw."", ""This isn't the meaningful movie it pretends to be. But as a goofy entertainment that speeds through the latter half of the 20th century, stopping here and there to snap a photo or two, Forrest Gump does just fine."", 'This tall tale may reach monumental proportions, but Forrest Gump always keeps its magical airiness and grace.', 'Warm, wise, and wearisome as hell.']"
