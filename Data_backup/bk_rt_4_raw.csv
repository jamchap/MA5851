"You are almost willing to forgive the cheesy emotional climax especially when it ends with Cruise's electric smile. This one's for Reacher, Cruise and Child fans alone.",Jack Reacher,2012,Jack Reacher: Never Go Back - Movie Reviews,"Mystery & Thriller , Action",2016,2017
"Jack Reacher: Never Go Back is dispiritingly formulaic, retaining much of the first film's swaggering masculinity, but none of its self-awareness.",Jack Reacher,2012,Jack Reacher: Never Go Back - Movie Reviews,"Mystery & Thriller , Action",2016,2017
"A bland and generic action flick, not just forgettable after the fact, but during.",Jack Reacher,2012,Jack Reacher: Never Go Back - Movie Reviews,"Mystery & Thriller , Action",2016,2017

Jack Reacher: Never Go Back is a sequel that didn't need to happen. The twisty-turny plot is overly complicated and aggressively average.,Jack Reacher,2012,Jack Reacher: Never Go Back - Movie Reviews,"Mystery & Thriller , Action",2016,2017
"Overall this is a slick action-adventure that has relevant reverberations from the American involvement in Afghanistan and Iraq, and touches on the complex nature of the war on terror.",Jack Reacher,2012,Jack Reacher: Never Go Back - Movie Reviews,"Mystery & Thriller , Action",2016,2017
"The feel for the epic that once gave this director's films a pop grandeur is also gone. He's made a totally anonymous movie, devoid of personality or interest.",Jack Reacher,2012,Jack Reacher: Never Go Back - Movie Reviews,"Mystery & Thriller , Action",2016,2017

A strident palette of candy-coloured empty calories and poop jokes and a cynical message about accepting yourself had me searching for an emoji showing a dispirited film critic hanging from a noose fashioned from a phone-charger cable.,The Emoji Movie,2017,The Emoji Movie - Movie Reviews,"Comedy , Adventure , Kids & Family , Animation",2017,2017

The Emoji Movie is based on an idea which must have seemed very clever in theory but turns out to be cumbersome in practice.,The Emoji Movie,2017,The Emoji Movie - Movie Reviews,"Comedy , Adventure , Kids & Family , Animation",2017,2017
"Certainly the idea of an Emoji Movie is worse than what is actually onscreen.

The movie is the latest multiplex filler to co-opt a classic tale only to drown it in computer-generated murk. Even the title has the ring of something created by committee.,Dracula Untold,2014,Dracula Untold - Movie Reviews,"Fantasy , Action , Horror",2014,2016

"Anyone hoping the franchise might open out into new thematic territory will be disappointed; this is the same old ritual, from the amped-up training sequences to the climactic title fight with its absurd number of punches landed in every round.",Creed,2015,Creed - Movie Reviews,Drama,2015,2016
"The rapport between Stallone and Jordan is fabulous, especially in the old-school training scenes, chasing chickens to improve speed and all the rest, that pay homage to the original, Oscar-winning 1976 film.",Creed,2015,Creed - Movie Reviews,Drama,2015,2016

"Creed packs a serious punch, replete with crunching fight sequences captured in a probing, prowling style.",Creed,2015,Creed - Movie Reviews,Drama,2015,2016
It's an invigorating piece of nostalgia that fuels a bigger adrenaline rush with its climax than any big-budget blockbuster could provide.,Creed,2015,Creed - Movie Reviews,Drama,2015,2016
"Coogler keeps everything moving so gracefully that by the end of Creed, we almost don't know what hit us.",Creed,2015,Creed - Movie Reviews,Drama,2015,2016
"Whether the credit goes to the director or the actor or both, this is the performance of Stallone's career, one in which that age-defying orange body stays covered up but his sadness is in full view.",Creed,2015,Creed - Movie Reviews,Drama,2015,2016

Maybe it was a sign that this film was ill-fated when it took almost 20 years for it to get off the ground.,Gemini Man,2019,Gemini Man - Movie Reviews,"Fantasy , Action , Mystery & Thriller , Sci-Fi",2019,2019
"Like an assault on your eyeballs. Maybe you get used to it, but you shouldn't... Some of the action is fun, but it's really hard to get past the look of it.",Gemini Man,2019,Gemini Man - Movie Reviews,"Fantasy , Action , Mystery & Thriller , Sci-Fi",2019,2019
"For a movie so reliant on its 3D pizzazz, Gemini Man is two-dimensional in every other way.",Gemini Man,2019,Gemini Man - Movie Reviews,"Fantasy , Action , Mystery & Thriller , Sci-Fi",2019,2019
"Will Smith (x2) and Mary Elizabeth Winstead make for an engaging lead duo in the middle of a very intriguing scenario, but there are too many half-baked components for Gemini Man to make much of an impression.",Gemini Man,2019,Gemini Man - Movie Reviews,"Fantasy , Action , Mystery & Thriller , Sci-Fi",2019,2019
Roll up. Roll up. See it now. See it once. And never see it again.,Gemini Man,2019,Gemini Man - Movie Reviews,"Fantasy , Action , Mystery & Thriller , Sci-Fi",2019,2019
Perhaps what's most impressive about 'Gemini Man' is how it performs the magic trick of taking $138 million and turning it into a low-budget made-for-Cinemax thriller.,Gemini Man,2019,Gemini Man - Movie Reviews,"Fantasy , Action , Mystery & Thriller , Sci-Fi",2019,2019
Never mind the silly science or that Smith's face is shoddily de-aged with digital technology to enable him to play Junior: it's simply hard to buy the actor as a weepy 23-year-old virgin.,Gemini Man,2019,Gemini Man - Movie Reviews,"Fantasy , Action , Mystery & Thriller , Sci-Fi",2019,2019

"Gemini Man [is] a perplexing conundrum, and for a thriller about an assassin who never misses a shot this is one motion picture that has a whole lot of trouble consistently hitting the target.",Gemini Man,2019,Gemini Man - Movie Reviews,"Fantasy , Action , Mystery & Thriller , Sci-Fi",2019,2019
"The same High Frame Rate that make the actors look like they're on Days of Our Lives makes the colors absolutely pop. And those textures on the skulls in the underground ossuary fight scene! It's cooler than the action, anyway.",Gemini Man,2019,Gemini Man - Movie Reviews,"Fantasy , Action , Mystery & Thriller , Sci-Fi",2019,2019
"All you could concentrate on is the bizarre format...there are Blade Runner-like ideas about souls and bodies and whatnot, but watching it was a totally distracting experience.",Gemini Man,2019,Gemini Man - Movie Reviews,"Fantasy , Action , Mystery & Thriller , Sci-Fi",2019,2019
