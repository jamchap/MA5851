Russell Crowe solidly anchors this epic-scale gladiator movie - the first in nearly four decades - by using his burly frame and expressive face to give dimension to what might otherwise have been comic book heroics.,Gladiator,2000,Gladiator - Movie Reviews,"Action , Adventure , History , Drama",2000,2011
"It is monumental movie-making: visually thrilling, technically astonishing, and emotionally engaging.",Gladiator,2000,Gladiator - Movie Reviews,"Action , Adventure , History , Drama",2000,2011
"The journey of Maximus, from triumph on the battlefield through despair and degradation in slavery and then to a final epiphany in the Colosseum is an exciting one - and Russell Crowe plays the character with considerable toughness and authority.",Gladiator,2000,Gladiator - Movie Reviews,"Action , Adventure , History , Drama",2000,2011
"Throughout it all, Crowe maintains a tough, slot-mouthed reticence; he is very persuasive as the superman of the Colosseum.",Gladiator,2000,Gladiator - Movie Reviews,"Action , Adventure , History , Drama",2000,2011
"In Russell Crowe, Scott has found an actor who can carry this movie the way Atlas was supposed to carry the globe of the world on his back -- in Crowe's case without stooping.",Gladiator,2000,Gladiator - Movie Reviews,"Action , Adventure , History , Drama",2000,2011
"Rather than getting lost in the world Scott has created on screen, Scott asks filmgoers to marvel at how he created that world, and how smoothly he succeeds in manipulating us.",Gladiator,2000,Gladiator - Movie Reviews,"Action , Adventure , History , Drama",2000,2011
"Gladiator is filled with brilliant filmmaking and features outstanding performances, but it's neither profound enough nor pop enough to be great -- it's mournful, serious, beautiful and, finally, pointless.",Gladiator,2000,Gladiator - Movie Reviews,"Action , Adventure , History , Drama",2000,2011
"Ridley Scott thrusts us so close to the combat that all we see is a lot of whirling and thrashing, a sword thrust here and there, a spurt of blood, a limb severed. There's hardly a scene that is cleanly and coherently staged in open space.",Gladiator,2000,Gladiator - Movie Reviews,"Action , Adventure , History , Drama",2000,2011
"If there's a soft spot in your heart for the sword-&-sandal epic, then you'll swoon with giddy delight over Gladiator.",Gladiator,2000,Gladiator - Movie Reviews,"Action , Adventure , History , Drama",2000,2011
"Crowe doesn't use tricks in this role to court our approval. He earns it the old-fashioned way, by daring to be quiet, if not silent, and intensely, implacably strong.",Gladiator,2000,Gladiator - Movie Reviews,"Action , Adventure , History , Drama",2000,2011
"The fusion of the ancient and the modern -- even to the point of some sly echoes of our own sports-mad society -- is seamless. Gladiator does indeed deliver the glory that was Rome, but it also clinically dissects the assumptions on which it was built.",Gladiator,2000,Gladiator - Movie Reviews,"Action , Adventure , History , Drama",2000,2011
"In the end, Gladiator is overdrawn and too insubstantial for its own good, just like the old days, but it satisfies as entertainment on a grand scale.",Gladiator,2000,Gladiator - Movie Reviews,"Action , Adventure , History , Drama",2000,2011
"Gladiator's combination of grim sanctimony and drenching, Dolby-ized dismemberings left me appalled.",Gladiator,2000,Gladiator - Movie Reviews,"Action , Adventure , History , Drama",2000,2011

"Ultimately, Gladiator is an honorable and inoffensive spectacle with nothing extraordinary to recommend it.",Gladiator,2000,Gladiator - Movie Reviews,"Action , Adventure , History , Drama",2000,2011
"Though the digital effects lack the weight and conviction of their equivalents in old Cecil B. De Mille movies, Ridley Scott's sword-and-sandal epic has some of the intensity of old Hollywood in terms of storytelling, spectacle, and violence.",Gladiator,2000,Gladiator - Movie Reviews,"Action , Adventure , History , Drama",2000,2011
"The cast is strong (notably Nielsen as Commodus's vacillating sister, and the late Oliver Reed, unusually endearing as a gladiator owner), the pacing lively, and the sets, swordplay and Scud catapults impressive.",Gladiator,2000,Gladiator - Movie Reviews,"Action , Adventure , History , Drama",2000,2011
"All the pieces are in place, but somehow they just donâ€™t come together.",Gladiator,2000,Gladiator - Movie Reviews,"Action , Adventure , History , Drama",2000,2011

"The soundtrack, including the Roy Orbison classic that gave the movie its name, is bopping, and the pacing is breezy.

It's saying Roberts' character becomes a better person when she lands a rich guy and learns to cry at the opera.,Pretty Woman,1990,Pretty Woman - Movie Reviews,"Romance , Comedy",In Theaters:,2014
"He pays her $3,000 and they fall in love -- ain't Hollywood grand?",Pretty Woman,1990,Pretty Woman - Movie Reviews,"Romance , Comedy",In Theaters:,2014

"Cars might get us into car world as a gimmick, but it doesn't get us into car world as a state of mind. Thus, the animation, rather than seeming like an expression of the movie's deeper truth, becomes an impediment to it.",Cars,2006,Cars - Movie Reviews,"Kids & Family , Adventure , Animation , Comedy",2006,2014
