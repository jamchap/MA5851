"Cameron knows the viewer will recognize Avatar's story from elsewhere, whether as the love affair between John Smith and Pocahontas or almost all of Ferngully and so tries to dazzle the viewer with ""shock and awe.""",Avatar,2009,Avatar - Movie Reviews,"Fantasy , Action , Adventure , Sci-Fi",2009,2016

"[The ending] is a masterpiece of popcorn tragedy: not deep, not sophisticated, barely even credible, but gut-clutching for those of us who have already lost the sensible use of our stomachs, as we would in any worthwhile fairground ride.",Titanic,1997,Titanic - Movie Reviews,"Romance , History , Drama",1997,2014
"The movie is a ride, and not without the odd moment of corniness. But it's also about freedom and flight, bondage and stagnation. And most fittingly, as a memorial itself, it's about memory and the act of remembering.",Titanic,1997,Titanic - Movie Reviews,"Romance , History , Drama",1997,2014
"No meager disaster movie, greased by generic formula and goosed by big-bucks technology... Titanic is one big, bruising movie that will appeal on different levels to different audiences.",Titanic,1997,Titanic - Movie Reviews,"Romance , History , Drama",1997,2014
"Cameron's aim was to set the most intimate love story possible against one of the century's biggest tragedies, and he very nearly pulls it off. DiCaprio has a captivating presence in a role that might have been written for a young Clark Gable.",Titanic,1997,Titanic - Movie Reviews,"Romance , History , Drama",1997,2014
"What I can tell you, risking puns, is that it swept me off my feet almost from the get-go, a grand epic romance-disaster that reminded me, in the middle of my overstuffed-with-movies life, of what we mean when we talk about the power of cinema.",Titanic,1997,Titanic - Movie Reviews,"Romance , History , Drama",1997,2014
"Sure, 'Titanic' may be corny, clumsy, and obvious-but the sincerity of its emotions and the power of its spectacle endure.",Titanic,1997,Titanic - Movie Reviews,"Romance , History , Drama",1997,2014
"Cameron has devised a tender love story between Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio that serves as the main focus of Titanic's storyline, and it works beautifully.",Titanic,1997,Titanic - Movie Reviews,"Romance , History , Drama",1997,2014
"If computer-generated special effects have overpowered human-generated drama, Cameron seizes that dangerously cold technology and recasts it as dream and delirium, profoundly human in its sources and longings.",Titanic,1997,Titanic - Movie Reviews,"Romance , History , Drama",1997,2014
"The execution is state-of-the-art and breathtaking. Titanic offers the full compass of courage and cowardice, and it stands as an achievement that truly is a night to remember at the movies.",Titanic,1997,Titanic - Movie Reviews,"Romance , History , Drama",1997,2014

"It has itself become, like the shipwreck, a cultural monument, only accreting value, not losing significance, as time goes by.",Titanic,1997,Titanic - Movie Reviews,"Romance , History , Drama",1997,2014
"Cameron's three-hour disaster epic is a triumph of popular art -- of folk art, really.",Titanic,1997,Titanic - Movie Reviews,"Romance , History , Drama",1997,2014

"[Cameron] stages the sinking with a flawless sense of detail, pacing, import and dread.",Titanic,1997,Titanic - Movie Reviews,"Romance , History , Drama",1997,2014
"For all of its flaws, this movie works in the way that classic Hollywood movies do. It delivers.",Titanic,1997,Titanic - Movie Reviews,"Romance , History , Drama",1997,2014
"It's both nostalgic and fresh, a tender homage to, especially, the initial Star Wars (""Episode IV: A New Hope""), as well as a bridge to help those of us stuck in the splendor of Hoth edge into the future.",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2015,Star Wars: The Force Awakens - Movie Reviews,"Fantasy , Action , Adventure , Sci-Fi",2015,2016

"Despite the copious servings of tragic threats and good feelings, the production sinks under the weight of its emotional calculation.",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2015,Star Wars: The Force Awakens - Movie Reviews,"Fantasy , Action , Adventure , Sci-Fi",2015,2016
"It all comes together nicely as the actors breathe vulnerability, fallibility and personality into their roles, with Daisy Ridley being quite the commanding presence. My favourite, hands down, is the cute and rotund droid BB-8.",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2015,Star Wars: The Force Awakens - Movie Reviews,"Fantasy , Action , Adventure , Sci-Fi",2015,2016

"But the movie can't sustain its playfulness-or its tension, either. Abrams is too busy trying to roll the original Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back into one two-hour-and-15-minute movie.",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2015,Star Wars: The Force Awakens - Movie Reviews,"Fantasy , Action , Adventure , Sci-Fi",2015,2016
"There is, of course, CGI in The Force Awakens, but it's comparatively minimal. The film looks handmade, and this allows for a greater range of human emotion, too. When tragedy strikes, you feel it.",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2015,Star Wars: The Force Awakens - Movie Reviews,"Fantasy , Action , Adventure , Sci-Fi",2015,2016
"The story is compelling. The acting is great. The technical aspects are solid. But it's hard to escape the idea that the film is a remix of something else, an attempt to rework story elements that felt more original elsewhere.",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2015,Star Wars: The Force Awakens - Movie Reviews,"Fantasy , Action , Adventure , Sci-Fi",2015,2016
"As with other installments, this is less a movie than an exercise in massaging a juvenile-minded audience that wants the experience to be new and familiar at the same time.",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2015,Star Wars: The Force Awakens - Movie Reviews,"Fantasy , Action , Adventure , Sci-Fi",2015,2016
"As a nostalgia trip that knows exactly what die-hard Star Wars fans want and then layers in some memorable new characters, The Force Awakens is exactly what it needs to be: an old-school Saturday afternoon sci-fi matinee writ big.",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2015,Star Wars: The Force Awakens - Movie Reviews,"Fantasy , Action , Adventure , Sci-Fi",2015,2016
"Like their Star Wars forebears, Boyega's Finn and Ridley's Rey are brave, funny, and admirable but also imperfect, uncertain, and sometimes afraid. That is to say, they're genuine, multisided characters with believable motivations.",Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2015,Star Wars: The Force Awakens - Movie Reviews,"Fantasy , Action , Adventure , Sci-Fi",2015,2016

"Infinity War didn't wear me down in the way that Age of Ultron did, it didn't give me the high of the first Avengers either. Like I said, manage expectations and you'll be just fine.",Avengers: Infinity War,2018,Avengers: Infinity War - Movie Reviews,"Action , Adventure , Sci-Fi , Fantasy",2018,2018
"The film's risk comes from the inherent need to 'balance' a myriad of characters' storylines, yet the story itself is nothing more than those same MCU building blocks.",Avengers: Infinity War,2018,Avengers: Infinity War - Movie Reviews,"Action , Adventure , Sci-Fi , Fantasy",2018,2018
"The conclusion of Infinity War is so shocking because it doesn't feel like a cliffhanger, more like a drastic wiping clean of the slate before the whole cycle starts again, with whatever reversal of fortune or comprehensive reboot it may be.",Avengers: Infinity War,2018,Avengers: Infinity War - Movie Reviews,"Action , Adventure , Sci-Fi , Fantasy",2018,2018

"The insubstantiality of the film isn't due to the infinite yet flimsy malleability of C.G.I. gimmickry but, instead, to the dispersion of its drama throughout the many cinematic installations set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",Avengers: Infinity War,2018,Avengers: Infinity War - Movie Reviews,"Action , Adventure , Sci-Fi , Fantasy",2018,2018
"This chaotic but surprisingly nimble instalment, directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, brings together an eye-popping ensemble cast of A-listers (imagine the table read!) and pushes them into playful new configurations.",Avengers: Infinity War,2018,Avengers: Infinity War - Movie Reviews,"Action , Adventure , Sci-Fi , Fantasy",2018,2018
"Never has the ""Marvel Cinematic Universe"" seemed like more of a universe, in ways both good and bad.

I don't think fans will be disappointed.",Avengers: Infinity War,2018,Avengers: Infinity War - Movie Reviews,"Action , Adventure , Sci-Fi , Fantasy",2018,2018
"Maybe the quips and the punch-ups are there because they have to be, what with the film's steady parade of failure and even death. Plans fail. Character fails. Even sacrifices fail.

Overseeing such a massive technical production as this one requires a filmmaker to be on top of every nuance and detail in play. Actor/director Favreau is the right person for the job.,The Lion King,2019,The Lion King - Movie Reviews,"Kids & Family , Adventure",2019,2019
The Lion King captures just enough of the original's warmhearted excitement -- and introduces enough new delights -- to feel like more than a cynical Disney money grab.,The Lion King,2019,The Lion King - Movie Reviews,"Kids & Family , Adventure",2019,2019
"Though by no means a bad movie, The Lion King would've been better off trying to be more of its own movie, do something different in terms of story and character, and aim as high narratively as it achieved with its extraordinary visuals.",The Lion King,2019,The Lion King - Movie Reviews,"Kids & Family , Adventure",2019,2019
"Even if you somehow made it into the new Lion King without knowing its origins, you might start to wonder if there was another version of it that made more sense...",The Lion King,2019,The Lion King - Movie Reviews,"Kids & Family , Adventure",2019,2019
The Lion King feels less like watching a cohesive film and more like listening to a separate audio track narrating what is happening onscreen. The two halves don't mesh.,The Lion King,2019,The Lion King - Movie Reviews,"Kids & Family , Adventure",2019,2019

The weight of the production and the hubris of its technological aspirations accent the story flaws that were always part of The Lion King. This is one Disney fable that should have stayed a handmade tale.,The Lion King,2019,The Lion King - Movie Reviews,"Kids & Family , Adventure",2019,2019
