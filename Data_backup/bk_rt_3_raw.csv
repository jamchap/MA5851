It's a strong rival for Star Trek among the summer's most purely exciting action films.,G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,2009,G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra - Movie Reviews,"Action , Adventure",2009,2012
"It is impossible to care for the Joes, so cursory is their characterisation, so bland are the actors.

So little plot and character that you'd be hard pressed to call this a 'film' in the strictest definition of the term.,Wrath of the Titans,2012,Wrath of the Titans - Movie Reviews,"Fantasy , Adventure , Action",2012,2012
